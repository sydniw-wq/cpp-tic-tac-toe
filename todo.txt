In order to complete the implementation of Tic Tac Toe we need to complete these items and pieces of logic.

We have the following components in the game that need to be defined to properly handle the game functionality.

1. Game Board
- managed by the board class, track the cells on the board to determine how the game is going

2. Players
- have to be able to manage the two players in the game
- players are represented by the Player class and have their own attributes which distinguish them when playing on the same board

3. Movement of Player
- functions within the board class allow us to track player movement (check valid moves)
- with this we can continue to update the game board for players

4. Game Logic
- TicTacToe class manages the actual logic of the game (rules to play by)
- it handles the players turns, takes car of I/O from the players and checks for win/draw conditions

5. Result
- Board class contains function to check the board and determine if win/lose/draw conditions have been met for players
